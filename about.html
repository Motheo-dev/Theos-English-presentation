      <h2>Why Books Are Better Than Movies</h2>
      <p>
        First, books give us imagination. When we read, we don’t just watch
        a scene unfold—we create it in our minds. The characters look the
        way we picture them, the setting feels real in our own unique
         way. Movies show you one version, but books let you build your
        own world.
      </p>
      <p>Second, books offer detail. A movie has about two hours to 
        tell a story, so a lot gets cut out—backgrounds, emotions, even
        entire characters. In books, we get the full experience: the
        character’s thoughts, feelings, and struggles. You don’t just
        see what happens, you understand why it happens.</p>
        <p>Third, books are personal. Everyone reads at their own pace.
         You can pause, reread, and reflect. Movies rush you forward
         whether you’re ready or not. With books, the story belongs to
         you—it’s an intimate conversation between the author and the
         reader.</p>
         <p>Lastly, books last longer. A movie might end and be
         forgotten in two hours, but a good book stays with you for weeks,
         even years. The lessons and emotions linger because you’ve invested
         time imagining and understanding</p>
         <p>So while movies entertain, books inspire. Books feed our
            imagination, deepen our understanding, and leave a lasting
            mark on our hearts. That’s why, in the battle of stories,
             books will always win.</p>
